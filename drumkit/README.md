This is an HTML document that includes a script with JavaScript code. 
The document includes a title, a stylesheet, and a script that uses event listeners to create a drum kit application. 
The HTML includes a set of divs that each represent a drum kit sound and are labeled with a key that corresponds to a keyboard key. 
The sounds are played when the corresponding key is pressed on the keyboard. The CSS file defines the visual appearance of the drum kit application.

The JavaScript code defines two functions: 
removeTransition and playSound. The removeTransition function is an event listener that removes 
a "playing" class from a div element that has been pressed after the transition has ended. 
The playSound function is also an event listener that is triggered when a key is pressed. 
It plays the corresponding audio file, adds the "playing" class to the div element associated with the pressed key, 
and calls the removeTransition function after the audio file has finished playing.

The script selects all the drum kit div elements and adds an event listener to each one to listen for the end of the transition. 
It also listens for a "keydown" event on the window and calls the playSound function when a key is pressed. 
This creates an interactive drum kit application that plays sounds when corresponding keys on the keyboard are pressed, 
with a visual effect that indicates which drum kit sound is being played.
